# Grovers-Algorithm
### The Problem
You've been invited to a dinner party and you cannot find that one sweater that you really want to wear. Chances are you'll tear apart your entire closet while searching for that one piece of clothing. 

Many industrial companies struggle with the same challenge, but replace clothing with data sets. Itâ€™s often difficult to locate a certain piece of data within _millions_ of other data sets.

### The Key to Optimizing Database Searching
Classical computers approach this problem the exact same way we do... **in an extremely time-consuming manner**. Luckily, quantum computers exist and can solve these types of issues really well.

I implemented Grover's Algorithm on 2 qubits through IBM's Qiskit to quadratically speed up the execution time of searching through unstructured data.

I also wrote an [Medium article](https://medium.com/@priyaltaneja/optimizing-database-searching-with-grovers-algorithm-cad50a603494) that breaks down the code and walks you through the technical aspects behind the code along with a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/HeYGWe20yqc) that highlights the advantages of Grover's algorithm!
